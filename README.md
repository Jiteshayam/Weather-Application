# Weather-Application
The Weather App is a mini-project designed to provide users with real-time weather information based on their current location or by searching for a specific city. With its simple and intuitive interface, the app offers two main functionalities to cater to the user's needs.

## Feature
### Current Location Weather:
Upon launching the app, it automatically detects the user's current location using GPS or IP-based geolocation. It then fetches the relevant weather data from a reliable weather API and displays it on the screen. Users can easily access essential weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy) for their present location.

### City Search:
In addition to the current location feature, the Weather App allows users to explore weather conditions in other cities as well. By typing the name of the desired city in the search bar, users can access weather data for that location instantly. The app communicates with the same weather API to fetch and present the relevant information to the user.
